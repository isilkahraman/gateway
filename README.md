Airline Ticketing API & AI Chat Agent

This project includes a basic airline ticketing API and a chatbot interface that works with it. The chatbot can process flight-related questions and give answers using either a dummy intent parser or OpenAI.

Technologies Used
Backend API: Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, JWT, Swagger

API Gateway: Node.js, Express, Axios

Frontend: React, Axios, Firebase Firestore

Optional AI: OpenAI API or a custom rule-based parser


Notes
By default, the system uses a dummy parser. You can switch to OpenAI in the gateway code.

All chat messages are saved to Firebase Firestore under the messages collection.
